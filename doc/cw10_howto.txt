Howto create projects for MSF lite in CodeWarrior 10.x IDE

Note:
The MSF lite projects in CW 10.5 for the FRDM-KL25Z board use the universal ARM-defined CMSIS (register definitions and init functions) rather than the Freescale-specific EWL definitions generated by the CW wizard.

1) Created normal bareboard project in CW 10.5 for MKL25Z128 
2) Add CMSIS files to the project (Import ... File System ... Select the CMSIS folders and files
 AND in Advanced select Link resources (do not copy the files to your workspace)

3) Add CMSIS SystemInit call to the CW startup routine __thumb_startup.
Otherwise, there were no changes in the low-level code.

The CW startup code by default does not initialize CPU clock, but the CMSIS SystemInit does this.
