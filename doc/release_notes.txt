Release Notes

What is new
------------
Version 6/2015
 - Updated documentation for Kinetis Design Studio 3.0.0 
 (new, simplified tutorial for creating project in KDS 3.0.0, see kds_howto3.0.0.txt, 
  CLOCK_SETUP now needs to be defined in compiler options)
 - Updated example projects to build in KDS 3.0.0 (-nanolibc option in Cross ARM C++ Linker > Miscellaneous Other linker flags options replaced with "-specs=nano.specs -specs=nosys.specs").
 - Debug configurations added to example projects (saved into project) so that they do not need to be created manually after import.

Version 2/2015
 - Added waveio driver for generating/measuring periodic signal nad pulses.
 - Added example project waveio for the waveio driver. 
 - Added example project input_capture which demonstrates use of the low-level

 are required than provided by the waveio high-level driver.
