Howto create projects for MSF lite in Kinetis Design Studio 1.1.1

------------------
Full manual setup
------------------
1) Create new KDS project in for Kinetis L > MKL2x > KL25Z >  MKL25Z128xxx4 
 
 - Do not enable use of  Processor Expert in the wizard
 - Note that if you do not create the project in the default location, the wizard 
 will not create a folder for your project; it will place the files directly 
 into the selected folder.

When the project is created, go to Processor Expert menu and select Hide Views to
close the PE views which we will not use. 
 
2) Create MSF folder in your project (in KDS by selecting the project and right-click
 + New > Folder)                                                       

3) Import the following folders to the project (to the MSF folder):
  - Import > General > File System > Select each folder (checkbox will 
 select all the files). 
 AND in Advanced select "Link resources" (do not copy the files to your workspace)
 AND check the "Create top folder" so that the CMSIS folder is also created in your project.
 - msf_lite\common
 - msf_lite\platform\kinetis
 - msf_lite\board\frdm_kl25z 
 

4) In Project Properties select C/C++ Build > Buil Variables.
Switch the Configuration at top of the window to Release or [All configurations] 
Add variable MSF_LOC and point it to your MSF_lite path, for example, "C:\msf_lite"
As the type select "Directory"
NOTE 1: You can also use path relative to your project location, 
  for example, ${ProjDirPath}\..\..\..\..\
NOTE 2: Adding the path in Resource > Linked Resources does not work.  

5) Right-click the project in Project Explorer and select Properties. 
Go to C/C++ Build > Settings > ARM C compiler... > Includes and add these paths:
"${MSF_LOC}/common"
"${MSF_LOC}/platform/kinetis"
"${MSF_LOC}/platform/kinetis/mkl25z"
"${MSF_LOC}/board/frdm_kl25z"

6) In the main file add these includes:
/* MSF configuration for this project */
#include "msf_config.h"
/* Include the core definitions - CMSIS <device>.h file etc.*/
#include "coredef.h"
#include "msf.h"

7) Copy msf_config.h and derivative.h files from [MSF lite]\template\kds to [your project]\Sources
If needed, edit the option(s) in the msf_config.h file (see "Configuration files"
below for more information).

8) Your project should now build without errors.


9) To Start debugging: 
- Right click the project and select Debug > Debug configurations...
- In the Debug configurations window right-click GDB PEMicro Interface Debug and
select New
- In the right-hand side of the window click on the Debugger tab
- In Interface select Open SDA Embedded debug - USB port
- In Device name select KL25Z128M4
- Click the Debug button (make sure your FRDM-KL25Z is connected )



Configuration files
---------------------
*) Your application includes msf_config.h. You should create this file locally in
each project by "clonning" the file provided in [MSF lite]\template\kds.

*) msf_config.h defines some options which are application-specific (CPU frequency)
and includes the main header file for the BOARD used in the application, e.g.
#include "frdm_kl25z.h"  (<board>.h file) 

*) The <board>.h file includes main configuration file for the MCU used in the board, e.g.
#include "msf_config_mkl25z.h" (msf_config_<device>.h 
This is internal file which you do not need to edit in most cases!
You can do so with care, however; it is no magic.
The <board>.h file also defines the constants for the board, e.g. pin names.

General advice: edit options msf_config.h as needed; do not edit the other files
included from this file unless you understand what you are doing.
